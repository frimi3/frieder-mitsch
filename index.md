# Welcome

I am a PhD student at the [LSE Government Department](https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities/People/frieder-mitsch/).

My research interest lies at the intersection of political economy and economic geography. My PhD work focuses on the consequences of economic change
in Germany and is supervised by David Soskice (LSE Government) and Neil Lee (LSE Geography).
